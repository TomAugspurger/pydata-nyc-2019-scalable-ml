# Scalable Machine Learning

## Dimensions of Scale

* CPU Bound vs. RAM Bounds (or both)

### CPU Bound Problems

* "Small" data (fits in memory)
* Takes too long to train / predict / transform
* Option 1: Buy / rent a bigger machine
* Option 2: Throw a cluster at the problem (or be smarter about your model) 
* Distributed Joblib
* `dask_ml.model_selection.{Randomized,Grid}SearchCV`

### RAM Bound Problems

* "Big" data (larger than memory)
* One option: buy (or rent) a bigger machine
*
